\description{
Create a plot from a flametree data frame
}
\details{
The \code{flametree_plot()} function provides several ways to
visualise the data created by the generative system implemented by
\code{flametree_grow()}. The background argument should be either be a
string specifying an RGB hex colour (e.g., "#000000") or else the name
of a colour recognised by R (see the \code{colours()} function for details).
Analogously, the palette argument should be a vector of colours. The palette
and background colours are interpreted slightly differently depending on
which style of plot is created. In most cases, the background argument is
used to set the plot background, and the palette is used to generate a
continuous colour palette using \code{scale_colour_gradientn()} from the
ggplot2 package or \code{colorRamp()} in grDevices.

The style argument should be a single string specifying one of the following
styles. Setting \code{style = "plain"} (the default) creates an output that
resembles the original "flametree" images: colours vary along the body of
the trees, and no "leaves" are drawn. Setting \code{style = "voronoi"}
creates a plot where the tree bodies are uniform in colour, and coloured
"leaves" are drawn at the top of the trees using a Voronoi tesselation of
the locations of the terminal nodes. Note that computing the tesselation is
computationally expensive, and this will likely produce errors if there are
too many nodes. The \code{style = "nativeflora"} style creates a plot in
which tree bodies are rendered as thin segments, with a proportion of those
segments removed, and small points are drawn at the end of each terminal
segment. Setting \code{style = "wisp"} is similar to the "nativeflora" style,
but no segments are removed, and the tree body is wider at the base. Finally,
if the user sets \code{style = "themegray"} the result will be a plot that
uses the traditional gray theme used in ggplot2, and
\code{style = "minimal"} produces a variant that does not use curved
segments.
