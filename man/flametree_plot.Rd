\usage{
flametree_plot(
  tree,
  background = "antiquewhite4",
  palette = "viridis::inferno"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{The data frame specifying the flametree}

\item{background}{The background colour of the image}

\item{palette}{A palette specification used by the paletteer package}
}
\value{
The output is ggplot2 object plots the coord_x and coord_y values
that define each segment as a bezier curve. To map each segment to its own
curve, the group aesthetic is id_path, and the geom is the geom_bezier2()
function in the ggforce package. The color aesthetic is mapped to seg_col,
and the size aesthetic is mapped to seg_wid.

The background colour can be set using the "backgroud" argument, and the
palette used to colour the segments is generated using the
scale_color_paletteer_c() function from the paletteer package. To select
the palette, the "palette" argument must take the form of a palette
specification understood by paletteer.
