\value{
The output of \code{flametree_grow()}` is a tibble with the following
columns: \code{coord_x}, \code{coord_y}, \code{id_tree}, \code{id_time},
\code{id_path}, \code{id_leaf}, \code{id_pathtree}, \code{id_step},
\code{seg_deg}, \code{seg_len}, \code{seg_col}, and \code{seg_wid}. Each
row in the tibble specifies a single point: every curved segment is defined
by three such rows.

The two "coord" columns are numeric variables that specify the location of
the point itself. The "id" columns are used as indicators of various kinds.
The \code{id_tree} column contains numbers specifying which tree each point
belongs to, and similarly the \code{id_time} column is a numeric identifier
that specifies the time point at which the point was generated (i.e., the
iteration of the generative process). The \code{id_step} column contains
a number (0, 1, or 2) indicating whether the point is the first point, the
midpoint, or the end point of the relevant curved segment in a tree. In
addition, there are two identifier columns used to denote the segments
themselves. The \code{id_path} column is numeric, and assigns value 1 to
the "first" segment (i.e., the lowest part of the tree trunk) for every
tree, with values increasing numerically for each subsequent segment. Values
for \code{id_path} will uniquely identify a segment within a tree, but when
multiple trees are generated there will be multiple segments that have the
same \code{id_path} value. If a unique identifier across trees is needed,
use the \code{id_pathtree} column, which is a character vector constructed
by pasting the \code{id_path} and \code{id_tree} values into a string, with
an underscore as the separator character.

In addition to the two coordinate columns and the six identifier columns,
the data generated by \code{flametree_grow()} contains four "seg" columns
that are intended to map onto different visual characteristics of a plot.
The \code{seg_deg} column specifies the orientation of the segment, whereas
\code{seg_len} denotes the length of the segment, \code{seg_col} specifies
the colour (as a numeric value that could be interpreted by a palette), and
\code{seg_wid} specifies the width of the segment. Note that this information
use used differently by the \code{flametree_plot()} function, depending on
what style of plot is generated.
